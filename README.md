### FINAL PROJECT

## Triangle Role Requirements 
- Which model did you choose and why?

Several linear transformations? Since we're optimizing car prices
Or maybe first cluster and then do the linear to judge the classifications (similar variables) better?

- How are you training your model?

Clustering (maybe) 
Perhaps a supervised machine learning model as input data is labeled.

- What is the model's accuracy?
TBD
- How does this model work?
TBD

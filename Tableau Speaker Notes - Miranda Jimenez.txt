Tableau's notes.

Slide 1:
- All sorts of brands and models
- multiple identical cars
- abundant clusters

Slide 2:
- left hand side, horse power:
- Highest point differ
- Ranges of horse power differ
- Right hand side, AVG cylinder #/heat

Slide 3:
- heat maps for more detail in horse power
- right hand side AVG horsepower/SIZE
- slight variation per size in horsepower 
- general divisions/distances between classifications remain the same.

Slide 4:
- unrealistic with numbers larger than a whoping thousand cars per heat -> crash and burn
- Thus the model gives a starter to the classifications rather than full fledged, ready to race heats.

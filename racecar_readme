We don't have a defined goal for this grouping, but we do know there exists some patterns in all of theses cars in which we can use to help group them into heats for my upcoming race

The race will involve seperate heats in which similar cars (as defined by our clustering algorthm) will be matched against each other. The purpose for using such a tool is due to the large amount of cartypes with unique car specs that would be too difficult dfor a human to simply categorize. On top of that, we don't even know what the categoriea are, so this clustering tool will help us get started, in which the next step will involve using Subject Matter Experts to further classify the much more organized data, (Which could also potentially be a supervised learning model).

Make
Model will be used later in the labelling process for when we group the cars

Year is a wildcard, but this does indirectly play a bit into the car performance
Fuel Type is debatable but still relevant
Horsepower is clearly relevant
Cylinder, cylinder count can help for later classification, but on the fince with this one
Transmission type is relevent
Driven wheels is also relevant

Number of doors not even questionable
Market Category not pertinant at all to performance

Vehicle size is the closes we have to a volume and weight which is relevent to top speed
Vehicle style is the closest category to the shape and also plays a role in top speed
Highway MPG is questionably relevant, but could potentially play a role in speed performance

city MPG is not relevant here as there will be no constant stops in this race

Popularity - who cares?
MSRP - Not relevant to speed at all

Through trial an error the cluster are well organized so outside of HP it is hard to gauge what other factors may come into play with clustering. Opting for PCA to help get a more robust plot

After PCA was used the cluster was based on that and the cars were grouped into one of 4 heats for the race.
